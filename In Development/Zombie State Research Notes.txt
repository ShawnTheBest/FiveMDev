Separating pulse from blood amount so player doesn't register as a "Normal" pulse when given sufficient amoutn of blood
Have Pulse based on not only blood. But other factors such as persons stamina, drug use "Healthyness", severities of injuries, types of injuries sustained.

Cannot use the Hospital to fix
Cannot use Morphine Overdose to induce death state again(Morphine Overdosing is broken)

Bandages have no effect
Headshots,Tazers, Falling,HeadButts, Beatings, Pistol whips cannot hurt the person(Immortal state)
